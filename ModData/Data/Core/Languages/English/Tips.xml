We're only doing the absolutely necessary pop-up tips to be able to understand the basics and unique mechanics of the game.

Text is shortest possible. Use simple words. Short sentences. Skip flavor.

Too many tips that pop-up means the player is interrupted, annoyed and stops reading all of them.

We can do longer explanatory tips that are only in the Compendium. E.g. Camera tip could have "More" that links to Camera (Advanced): arrows keys, mouse wheel, zoom, middle mouse rotate. Similarly for Combat.

	<entry name="DamageCalculation" value="Damage Calculation"/>
	<entry name="DamageCalculationDescription" value="There are a few important concepts to understand about damage calculation.<br/><br/>Each unit has a number of identical group members, with the unit’s total hitpoints being composed of the hitpoints of each individual group member. When a unit loses hitpoints equivalent to a group member, that member dies and no longer contributes its weapons to attacks, effectively reducing inflicted damage by the fraction that squad member represents. Healing the unit will bring the group member back to life, restoring the unit’s power. Units with only 1 squad member, such as large units, become damaged when below 50% hitpoints which reduces their accuracy by 33%.<br/><br/>When calculating a weapon’s final inflicted damage, the weapon’s damage value is first capped by the target unit’s group member hitpoints. That means a single attack of a weapon can never do more damage than there are hitpoints for an individual member in the target group. That is, a 6 damage weapon against a Militants group where each Militant has 2 hitpoints can never deal more than 2 damage. For single group member units, such as large units, this is irrelevant as their total hitpoints equals their member hitpoints.<br/><br/>After the hitpoints cap, attacks, accuracy and the target’s armor and other damage reductions are all applied multiplicatively.<br/><br/>Attacks specifies the number of attacks a weapon makes against its target when the unit attacks. This is the most valuable stat to increase, because it scales the damage after the hitpoints cap. And unlike accuracy it is unbounded in the upper limit.<br/><br/>Accuracy can range from 2 to 12, each point being 1/12 or 0.083 that is multiplied into the final damage value. It cannot be decreased below 2 or increased above 12.<br/><br/>Armor and other damage reductions (cover, evasion, city, invulnerable) of the same type are added together and then each reduce the damage by their corresponding factor multiplicatively, but no individual type can reduce the damage by more than 10/12 or 83%. Armor penetration indicates how many points of armor are ignored. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all damage reductions apply to both melee and ranged weapons.<br/><br/>Traits are built on top of and use these elementary concepts. For example, weapons with the splash trait gain additional attacks for each extra living member in the target group, and weapons with the ignore cover trait ignore cover damage reduction of the target unit.<br/><br/>Some consequences of all this:<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Increasing the damage of a weapon may not increase the inflicted damage.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Infantry are tankier than their hitpoints might indicate. Single attack high damage non-splash weapons won’t be able to kill more than 1 group member. And at full hitpoints won’t even be able to kill 1 group member unless the weapon has 100% accuracy.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>To kill infantry, it’s better to have high accuracy, more attacks or splash.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Hitpoint gains from leveling are less useful for low hitpoints group members. The increase in hitpoints is canceled out by the increase in group member hitpoints cap, making it worthless against weapons that already exceed the cap.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Healing is more valuable on infantry.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Modifying low accuracy by a flat amount is more valuable than modifying high accuracy. E.g. increasing accuracy from 6 to 8 (50% to 67%) is a 33% damage increase. However, increasing accuracy from 8 to 10 (67% to 83%) is a 25% damage increase.<br/><icon texture='GUI/Bullet'/>Damage reduction of the same type has increasing returns. E.g. increasing armor from 0 to 1 will only give an (12-0)/(12-1)=+9% increase in survivability. However, increasing armor from 9 to 10 will give a (12-9)/(12-10)=+50% increase in survivability."/>
